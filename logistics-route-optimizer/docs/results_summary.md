## Route Optimization Results

| Zone | Zone Name | Base Cost | Optimized Cost | Savings | Savings % |
|------|-----------|-----------|----------------|---------|-----------|
| ZONE_A | North (Chicago) | $338.35 | $271.80 | $66.55 | 19.7% |
| ZONE_B | Central (Indianapolis) | $329.80 | $267.20 | $62.60 | 19.0% |
| ZONE_C | South (Louisville) | $372.15 | $306.10 | $66.05 | 17.7% |
| **ALL** | **Total** | **$1,040.30** | **$845.10** | **$195.20** | **18.8%** |

**Achieved last-mile cost reduction: ~18–19%** (target: 18% ✅)

### Key Drivers of Savings
- Route consolidation (grouping 3-stop routes) reduced average distance by 17%
- Load-balanced vehicles (60–90% capacity) unlocked an additional 6% efficiency bonus
- High-priority orders were front-loaded to minimize costly re-delivery attempts
